** TODO support holding down keys
** TODO give tile edges definition
** TODO show upcoming block
** TODO show score (lines)
** TODO increase speed as the game progresses

* future
** TODO develop AI that learns what blocks trip up a player the most
specify good outcomes like...
- created an overhang
- created a whole
- ended the game
- made the maximum height differential greater by x amount

and bad outcomes like...
- player got x lines
- decreased maximum height differential

Feed state of board into neural network with a set of outcomes, each
representing a block. Train by determining how good or bad an outcome
it was using the above criteria, and giving a score for how much to
strengthen or weaken the neural path taken.

Each player may evoke different behavior from the AI, which would be awesome.

Limit the AI by enforcing that each block must be used every X
blocks. Prevent the game from being boring due to lots of z's or s's.
